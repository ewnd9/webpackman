# webpackman/examples

Due to test specifics you need to install webpackman without adding it to `package.json`

Or maybe I could rewrite inside tests path to the project (webpackman module) (sounds better)

## Create new example

```
$ node test/helpers/generate-screenshots-cli <project-name> to generate screenshots
```
